1. Bike Sales - Project 1<br/><br/>
   I have worked on cleaning bike sales data, formatted it, added new columns and created pivot tables to easily visualize bike sales in the form of graphs like line and bar charts. Used slicers to dynamically
   update the data for quick analysis. This did give me some major insights into bike sales on how avergae salary of user, age bracket and commute to work place increased the bike sales. This surely with help
   in targeting certain audience to increase bike sales. <br/><br/>

2.Coffee Bean Sales - Project 2<br/><br/>
  This time I went a little further and used timeline to dynamically select certain period of the year to see how the sales did. I also, used slicer and connected all of them to the pivot tables created. I majorly
  concentrated on finding the top countries, toP customers, sales over time which actually are important in this dataset. I found United States to be top consumer of coffee from the dataset with very high sales
  compared to other countries. I also created custom slicers and timeline design to follow certain colour palette.<br/><br/>
